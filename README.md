-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#The CS255: The Business Requirements Document and The System Design Document. Below I will explain what this project was about.---------------------------------------------------------

# This Project was about creating a software for a company called DriverPass. Their plan was to make a software and website that could help new drivers or even experianced drivers learn more about driveing, help drivers ace their drivers test, and create better drivers for the road. In this project I feel as if I had a great grasp on the concepts that were being asked of me and how everything needed to work together to make this project come to light. If I had to pick something in this project that I could revise I would like to go back to the diagrams I made and improve them. While I feel as if I had a good grasp on what the diagrams mean and that I can make them, I know I could do better on them and better convey what it is that each one is doing. The nect thing I want to state is the user needs where a big concern throught this project. In it we were tasked with always thinking about how the user will see this sytem and how to make it so that it is user friendly. This is important as the user is the main body that will be uing this site constantly. If the system is too complex for the average person with no technial background to use then no-one will use the system because it will be too hard to understand. Lastly is some steps that I personally took to designing this software. I looked at what wanted to be done by DriverPass and try to figure out how to implement everything they wanted in the sytem in a way that can be easily understood by their team and, hypothetically, mine. Doing so but their needs for the system as the for front of the project. I also wanted the system to be easy to use for them and for the users, as per their request. Doing this the future I would use a vision board or a text document to lay out all the things that need to be implemented and what needs to be done to implement them as a visual aid on what needs to be done. I will keep their needs in my intrest and the ease of use of the system for not only those who will use continue it after me but those will use the system on a daily basis.

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem that we were working on this whole course was we had to make a C++ program that would search through binary trees and branching functions to make a strong reusable code to search through a file that a user would input. That file would hold information about classes and print out a list of classes and their prerequisits for the user to get their class schedule.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem with a little bit of uncertainity as I have only worked iwth data structures  ahanfiul of times before this. It was a good learning experiance and a goood way to learn more about data structers as a really nice way to get a better grasp of what a data structure is. This also help me understand why they can be very impirtant in a code that is handeling a large ammount of information and how it can better handle that information for the user to easily navigate it.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

# Roadbloacks are a common thing, at least for me, when working with code. I handle it by stepping away for alittle bit or moving on to something else so I can come back with a fresh mindset and clrear eyes because sometimes it is a simple mistake that you can not see at that exact moment. If it is clear that is a little more complicated than a simple mistake I would start looking into the problem running debug and seeing where it is failing and how I can about fixing that problem so I can move the code along.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This work has made me really focuse more on commenting on what each line or each section og code is doing, not only for me butwhoever is going to look at it, so everyone involved can see my thought process and how I came to this solution. It is even good for when I step awaya nd inevitably forget what I was doing and servers as a reminder of what I was trying to do. It also helped me with writing better more modular, maintainable, and re-usable code.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

It really helped. Before I thought my code was good and that it could be used but I see now that it had its flaws. Doing this project I can see now how to reliably write mroe maintainable code, make it readable for everyone involved, and more adatpable for future changes to the code.

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artimis Financial is a financial company that handles peoples portfolios. They needed an update on their sercurity software to help better protect the sensative information that is being sent throught their servers.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I feel like it did a pretty good job at identifying some of the security vulnerabilies in the code. I feel like I could do better but that would just take time and practice. It is important to code securly as it not only protects the information of the company but more importantly the information of the useres who will be using that company. A strong sense and value of securty that a company puts on the overall securty of its users and their software, in my mind, shows that they care about what they are doing and who they are doing it with and really aids a overall wellbing and longevity of a company.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

At first the entitry of the assessment was a bit of a challange. I had never done or seen something like before and it was overwhelming. After underatnding ehat I am looking at it was quite interesting to see all that informaition that it was givng me and to have a basic underatdning of what it was telling me was a nice as well.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Things to increase the layers of secuirty could be like implmenting strict access controls, encryption of dtat in transit and at rest and a implementation of a regulary scheduled security audits. Real time monitoring and intrusion detection would also greatly benifite the security of a system. Addressing future concerns could be using things like static and dynamic code analysis tools to help identify and mitigate security risks. OWASP offers a wide range of security applications that could be implemented to help offer some future protetcion measures. 

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Using secure practices and implementation into the code to make sure the cdode was safely and securly deployed as a way I made the code was functional and seucre before it was sent it. To make sure no new secrity risks were made after refactoring I used static testing to make sure that were none new risks that could have come up after refactoring and fixing any that could have possibly come from refractoring.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Adopting practices from OWASP, whish was a big resources that was used throughout the whole course, was a pretty big tool that was used to help maintain secure coding practices wer used.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them this exact file that I have uploaded here. I think it showes my compitence of the tools used to complete this project and the knowldege of that I do nknow how to use these tools effectivly.

Here I will be talking about the 7-1 Milestone project folder (it contains my 3D scene that was the main project for this course.) and the 2-3 Milestone paper that was the original idea and workings for the this project and explains what I plalned to do with the project.

How I approached this project is I typically like to start from the hardest and move to the simplest. This way the parts of the project that will take mroe time and effort to get through are already done and I can more quickly work through the things I know more about. Doing this can help very much in future work as the harder more complicated things can take up more time as there is more work to do to sorth through it and figure out how to do it. By working the harder things first you can be done with it and move onto something that is easier fo you to do ableing you to work more effciently and faster. How I approach developing programs is to dice straight in and figure out how the program works. I did that here in this project by diving into the first assignment given and working around to try and fighure how things are coded, how this all fits together, and how it works and why. I actually reffred back to previous assignments all through the semester as new things were taught to see how I would get them to fit within the existing code so that it flows correctly and works. Computer Science can help me reach my goal in my futire endevors as it is teaching me new coding languages, frameworks, and programs that I can take into my future works. For instance in CS-330 we learned about computation graphic and visualization and learned to use OpenGL. I can take what I learned here, building on my knowldege of C++ and new resources of handling rendered scenes, and expand upon them makeing more programs and scenes in and outside of the OpenGL program.

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by running testing on it. Running testing to make sure that everything is working to the requirements and that the actual program is fucntioning as intened is crucial when developing and by performing tests on the code is a great way to ensure that it is working correctly.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

How to interpret user need in a program and put them in you would need to ask. You would need to have people use the program and see what it is that needs to chnaged, added, or taken away all based on actual input from people who will be unsing this software.

# How do I approach designing software?

How you cna approach desiging a software is by asking questions. Questions like who is the intended software for, what will they use it to achieve, what are somethings that could be in that would make it easier for the intented audiance. Getting a basis for your design of the software is crucial because without a basis there is nothing to work off of.

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing maintainable and adaptable proams involves modular desgin, consistent naming conventions, and clear documentation. The CRUD Python module in this Project made it easier to connect widgets to the databse by utilizing reusable functions. This approach simplifies future adaptations and allows for easier debugging and tetsing.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems by analyzing requirments, planning a modular desgin, and iteratively refining the solution. For Grazioso Salvare, this meant carefully designing the database interactions and dashboard integration. Future projects will benefit from the same approach, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists develop and optimize software systems, which are crucial for modern businesses. My work on the Grazioso Salvare project helps the comapnay manage data efficiently, leading to better decision-making and improved services, demonstrating the practical impact of computer science in real-world applications.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app included a login screen, an inventory management screen, and an SMS permission screen. The UI was designed with simplicity and ease of navigation in mind, ensuring users could perform tasks efficienly. These designes were successful becasue they focused on clear functionality and user experience.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached coding with a focus on modular design, breaking down features into manageable somponents. Strategies like using clear naming conventions and iterative testing ensured a clean, maintainable codebase. These strategies can be applied in future projects to maintain code quality and adaptability. 

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested the app through unit testing and real-world scenario testing to ensure all functions worked as intended. This process is crucial for identifying bugs early and ensuring the app meets user needs. It revealed areas where the user experiance could be further improved.

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One challenge was inyegrating the SMS permisison feature seamlessly with the inventory management system. I had to innocate by creating a streamlined workflow that allowed users to switch between screens without disrupting their tasks.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The inventory management system was particularly successful, demonstrating my ability to create a functional, user-friendly interface that effectivly managed data while incorporating my knowledge of backend database integration.

# Reflection on the Pirate Intelligent Agent Project

# What did I do in this project?
In this project, I worked on developing an intelligent agent for a pirate-themed treasure hunt game. The goal was to teach the agent to navigate through a grid-like environment and make decisions that would lead it to the treasure while avoiding obstacles. I was provided with a basic framework for the environment and a skeleton code for the agent. From there, I implemented the Q-learning algorithm, which helped the agent learn from its experiences. I also used a neural network to approximate the Q-values for each state-action pair, enabling the agent to generalize its decisions across different situations.

Most of the work I did involved setting up the reinforcement learning process, training the model, and adjusting key parameters like the learning rate, exploration rate, and discount factor. These adjustments were necessary to ensure the agent could balance between exploring new options and exploiting what it had already learned.

# How does this connect to computer science?
This project really helped me see the bigger picture of what computer scientists do and why it’s important. At its core, computer science is about problem-solving and creating systems that make decisions or carry out tasks efficiently. In this project, I got to apply what I’ve learned about algorithms, neural networks, and machine learning to a real-world problem. Reinforcement learning, in particular, is something that has wide-ranging applications, from games like this one to more complex systems like robotics and autonomous vehicles. It's exciting to see how the concepts we learn in class can lead to real-world solutions.

# How do I approach problems as a computer scientist?
In this project, my approach was very methodical. First, I broke down the problem—understanding how the environment worked and what the agent was supposed to achieve. Then, I implemented the Q-learning algorithm step by step, starting with simple decisions and adding complexity as I went. A lot of time went into fine-tuning the parameters and testing different strategies to see what worked best. This process of iterating, testing, and refining is something I’ve learned is key to problem-solving in computer science.

# What are my ethical responsibilities?
One thing that stood out to me during this project was the importance of ethical considerations in AI. As computer scientists, we have a responsibility to ensure that the systems we design are safe, fair, and transparent. For example, in reinforcement learning, we need to make sure the agent is learning to make decisions in a way that doesn’t harm the user or produce biased results. If this were applied in a real-world scenario, such as healthcare or finance, the stakes would be much higher. So, it's important to consider not just how well the agent performs, but also the potential consequences of its actions.
