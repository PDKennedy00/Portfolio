# This portfolio is show my skills through work I have done in my classes as well as work that has been done outside of it.

#The CS255: The Business Requirements Document and The System Design Document. Below I will explain what this project was about.
# This Project was about creating a software for a company called DriverPass. Their plan was to make a software and website that could help new drivers or even experianced drivers learn more about driveing, help drivers ace their drivers test, and create better drivers for the road. In this project I feel as if I had a great grasp on the concepts that were being asked of me and how everything needed to work together to make this project come to light. If I had to pick something in this project that I could revise I would like to go back to the diagrams I made and improve them. While I feel as if I had a good grasp on what the diagrams mean and that I can make them, I know I could do better on them and better convey what it is that each one is doing. The nect thing I want to state is the user needs where a big concern throught this project. In it we were tasked with always thinking about how the user will see this sytem and how to make it so that it is user friendly. This is important as the user is the main body that will be uing this site constantly. If the system is too complex for the average person with no technial background to use then no-one will use the system because it will be too hard to understand. Lastly is some steps that I personally took to designing this software. I looked at what wanted to be done by DriverPass and try to figure out how to implement everything they wanted in the sytem in a way that can be easily understood by their team and, hypothetically, mine. Doing so but their needs for the system as the for front of the project. I also wanted the system to be easy to use for them and for the users, as per their request. Doing this the future I would use a vision board or a text document to lay out all the things that need to be implemented and what needs to be done to implement them as a visual aid on what needs to be done. I will keep their needs in my intrest and the ease of use of the system for not only those who will use continue it after me but those will use the system on a daily basis. 

#CS 300: Project 1 and Project 2.
#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem that we were working on this whole course was we had to make a C++ program that would search through binary trees and branching functions to make a strong reusable code to search through a file that a user would input. That file would hold information about classes and print out a list of classes and their prerequisits for the user to get their class schedule.

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem with a little bit of uncertainity as I have only worked iwth data structures  ahanfiul of times before this. It was a good learning experiance and a goood way to learn more about data structers as a really nice way to get a better grasp of what a data structure is. This also help me understand why they can be very impirtant in a code that is handeling a large ammount of information and how it can better handle that information for the user to easily navigate it.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

#Roadbloacks are a common thing, at least for me, when working with code. I handle it by stepping away for alittle bit or moving on to something else so I can come back with a fresh mindset and clrear eyes because sometimes it is a simple mistake that you can not see at that exact moment. If it is clear that is a little more complicated than a simple mistake I would start looking into the problem running debug and seeing where it is failing and how I can about fixing that problem so I can move the code along.

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This work has made me really focuse more on commenting on what each line or each section og code is doing, not only for me butwhoever is going to look at it, so everyone involved can see my thought process and how I came to this solution. It is even good for when I step awaya nd inevitably forget what I was doing and servers as a reminder of what I was trying to do. It also helped me with writing better more modular, maintainable, and re-usable code.

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

It really helped. Before I thought my code was good and that it could be used but I see now that it had its flaws. Doing this project I can see now how to reliably write mroe maintainable code, make it readable for everyone involved, and more adatpable for future changes to the code. 

#CS 305:

#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artimis Financial is a financial company that handles peoples portfolios. They needed an update on their sercurity software to help better protect the sensative information that is being sent throught their servers.

#What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I feel like it did a pretty good job at identifying some of the security vulnerabilies in the code. I feel like I could do better but that would just take time and practice. It is important to code securly as it not only protects the information of the company but more importantly the information of the useres who will be using that company. A strong sense and value of securty that a company puts on the overall securty of its users and their software, in my mind, shows that they care about what they are doing and who they are doing it with and really aids a overall wellbing and longevity of a company.

#What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

At first the entitry of the assessment was a bit of a challange. I had never done or seen something like before and it was overwhelming. After underatnding ehat I am looking at it was quite interesting to see all that informaition that it was givng me and to have a basic underatdning of what it was telling me was a nice as well.

#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Things to increase the layers of secuirty could be like implmenting strict access controls, encryption of dtat in transit and at rest and a implementation of a regulary scheduled security audits. Real time monitoring and intrusion detection would also greatly benifite the security of a system. Addressing future concerns could be using things like static and dynamic code analysis tools to help identify and mitigate security risks. OWASP offers a wide range of security applications that could be implemented to help offer some future protetcion measures. 

#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Using secure practices and implementation into the code to make sure the cdode was safely and securly deployed as a way I made the code was functional and seucre before it was sent it. To make sure no new secrity risks were made after refactoring I used static testing to make sure that were none new risks that could have come up after refactoring and fixing any that could have possibly come from refractoring.

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Adopting practices from OWASP, whish was a big resources that was used throughout the whole course, was a pretty big tool that was used to help maintain secure coding practices wer used.

#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them this exact file that I have uploaded here. I think it showes my compitence of the tools used to complete this project and the knowldege of that I do nknow how to use these tools effectivly.
